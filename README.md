The instructions on how to use my program are fairly simple as it is not super user interactive. The program is designed
to run by itself once it begins. However, it will not begin until the user answers the prompted question that will show
up in the Python Console. So, once you hit run, respond to the question, and then just sit back and watch the program do
what it is designed to do.
